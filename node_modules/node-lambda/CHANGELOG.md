## [0.8.0] - 2016-04-18
### Added
- CHANGELOG to ["make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release"](http://keepachangelog.com/). Linked to from README
- LICENSE to be more explicit about what was defined in `package.json`. Linked to from README
- It is OK to not set default value for AWS Credentials so AWS can use Roles and internally set AWS credentials

- Updated the AWS API version used to `2015-03-31`
